# Advent of Code 2022
This year I'm trying to learn Rust through Advent of Code.
It's unlikely to be the most beautiful code you've ever seen.

## Usage
```
Usage: aoc2022 [options]

Options:
    -d, --day [1..25]   specify which day to run
    -p, --part [1|2|all]
                        specify which part to run
    -f, --file FILE     specify file to use for input
    -h, --help          print this help menu
```
`day`, `part` and `file` are all required arguments.
